JavaScript Promises make handling asynchronous operations like API calls, file loading, or time delays easier. Think of a Promise as a placeholder for a value that will be available in the future. It can be in one of three states

Pending: The task is in the initial state.
Fulfilled: The task was completed successfully, and the result is available.
Rejected: The task failed, and an error is provided.
Here is an example Promise to check if a number is even. If yes, it resolves; otherwise, it rejects.




 
let checkEven = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let number = 4;
    if (number % 2 === 0) resolve("The number is even!");
    else reject("The number is odd!");
});
checkEven
    .then((message) => console.log(message)) // On success
    .catch((error) => console.error(error)); // On failure
Note: The "resolve" and "reject" are not keywords. you can use any name that you want to give to a function.

Syntax

let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Perform async operation
    if (operationSuccessful) {
        resolve("Task successful");
    } else {
        reject("Task failed");
    }
});
resolve(value): Marks the promise as fulfilled and provides a result.
reject(error): Marks the promise as rejected with an error.
Let's See Advanced Promise Methods and Patterns for Effective Async Handling

1. Promise.all() Method

Waits for all promises to resolve and returns their results as an array. If any promise is rejected, it immediately rejects.




 
Promise.all([
    Promise.resolve("Task 1 completed"),
    Promise.resolve("Task 2 completed"),
    Promise.reject("Task 3 failed")
])
    .then((results) => console.log(results))
    .catch((error) => console.error(error));
Output

Task 3 failed
2. Promise.allSettled() Method

Waits for all promises to settle (fulfilled or rejected) Method and returns an array of their outcomes.




 
Promise.allSettled([
    Promise.resolve("Task 1 completed"),
    Promise.reject("Task 2 failed"),
    Promise.resolve("Task 3 completed")
])
    .then((results) => console.log(results));

Output
[
  { status: 'fulfilled', value: 'Task 1 completed' },
  { status: 'rejected', reason: 'Task 2 failed' },
  { status: 'fulfilled', value: 'Task 3 completed' }
]
3. Promise.race() Method

Promise.race() Method resolves or rejects as soon as the first promise settles.




 
Promise.race([
    new Promise((resolve) =>
        setTimeout(() =>
            resolve("Task 1 finished"), 1000)),
    new Promise((resolve) =>
        setTimeout(() =>
            resolve("Task 2 finished"), 500)),
]).then((result) =>
    console.log(result));
Output

Task 2 finished
4. Promise.any() Method

Promise.any() Method resolves with the first fulfilled promise. If all are rejected, it rejects with an AggregateError.




 
Promise.any([
    Promise.reject("Task 1 failed"),
    Promise.resolve("Task 2 completed"),
    Promise.resolve("Task 3 completed")
])
    .then((result) => console.log(result))
    .catch((error) => console.error(error));

Output
Task 2 completed
5. Promise.resolve() Method

Promise.resolve() Method returns a promise that resolves with the given value.




 
Promise.resolve("Immediate success")
    .then((value) => console.log(value));

Output
Immediate success
6. Promise.reject() Method

Promise.reject() Method returns a promise that immediately rejects with a given reason.


 Promise.reject("Immediate failure")
    .catch((error) => console.error(error));
Output:

Immediate failure
7. Promise.finally() Method

Promise.finally() Method runs a cleanup or final code block regardless of the promiseâ€™s result (fulfilled or rejected).




 
Promise.resolve("Task completed")
    .then((result) => console.log(result))
    .catch((error) => console.error(error))
    .finally(() => console.log("Cleanup completed"));

Output
Task completed
Cleanup completed
8. Chaining with Promise.prototype.then() Method

Allows sequential execution of promises, passing results to the next .then() Method.




 
Promise.resolve(5)
    .then((value) => value * 2) // Multiplies by 2
    .then((value) => value + 3) // Adds 3
    .then((finalValue) => console.log(finalValue)); // Logs: 13

Output
13
9. Sequential Execution with Array.prototype.reduce()




 
let tasks = [1, 2, 3];
tasks.reduce((prevPromise, current) => {
    return prevPromise.then(() => {
        return new Promise((resolve) => {
            console.log(`Processing task ${current}`);
            setTimeout(resolve, 500); // Simulate async task
        });
    });
}, Promise.resolve());
Output

Processing task 1
Processing task 2
Processing task 3
10. Dynamic Promise Creation

Creating and resolving promises dynamically for runtime-based decisions.


 function asyncTask(taskName) {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => 
            resolve(`${taskName} completed`), 1000);
    });
}
asyncTask("Download File").then((result) => 
    console.log(result));
Output:

 Download File completed
